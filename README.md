# industriuka

I developed a demo application and physical platform for Industriuka 2024, on behalf of Bouvet.

The application retrieves data from a LiDAR sensor connected to my computer via Power over Ethernet (PoE). After processing and formatting the data, it is saved to a CSV file.

PowerBI continuously reads this file at 5-second intervals, generating real-time graphs that display volume measurements from storage bins.

In the demo, a user remotely controls a wheel loader to transfer rice (or another product) between bins, while the LiDAR sensor tracks and records the volume changes in real-time.

There is also a camera connected to the wheel loader to give a POV view of the driver.
